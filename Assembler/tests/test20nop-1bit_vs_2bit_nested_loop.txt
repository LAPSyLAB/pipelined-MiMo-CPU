/*
using 1-bit predictor: 50/100 predictions are incorrect 
this makes total sense as a 1-bit predictor is wrong on loop enter and loop exit, and since our loops are alternating we are wrong half the time
using 2-bit predictor: 25/100 predictions are incorrect, we increased the efficiency of our predictions by half!
