@this is a revised example showing the efficiency of a 2-bit predictor over a 1-bit predictor

while (true){
	if(a % 2 == 0){jump1}	TNTNTNTNTNT
	a++		
}

loop: 
rem r0, r0, #2
cmp r0, #0
jeq jump1
add r0, r0, #1
j loop

jump1:
add r0, r0, #1
add r1, r1, #1
j loop

/*
using 1-bit predictor: 50/100 predictions are incorrect 
this makes total sense as a 1-bit predictor is wrong on loop enter and loop exit, and since our loops are alternating we are wrong half the time
using 2-bit predictor: 25/100 predictions are incorrect, we increased the efficiency of our predictions by half!
