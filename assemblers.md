# Assemblers

The assembler and micro assembler files can be found inside the Assembler folder.

Microcode for all instructions is already written in the **microcode.txt** file

Running them is similar as before:

* We open command prompt and enter: **assembler.exe filename.txt**
* This produces a **filename.iram** file intended for the Instruction RAM and a **filename.oram** file intended for the Operand RAM.
* The same goes for the **microassembler.exe** file which produces a single **\*.rom** file.
