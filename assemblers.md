# Assemblers

The assembler and microassembler files can be found inside the Assembler folder.

Microcode for all instructions is already written in the **microcode.txt** file

Running them is similar as before:

* We open command prompt and enter: **assembler.exe filename.txt**
* This produces a **filename.ram** file intended for the Intruction RAM.
* The same goes for the **microassembler.exe** file which produces a **\*.rom** file.

One shortcoming for now is that I have no way to assemble code for the Operand RAM. Values must be manually added there.
